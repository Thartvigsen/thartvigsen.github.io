I'm a Ph.D student in Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute focusing on sequential machine learning, advised by [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and collaborating with [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) and [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

# Interests

I am broadly interested in studying *useful* representations of the world that allow computers to solve problems. Recently, this agenda has led me down the path of recurrent neural networks (RNN), which loosely emulate human information representation. I am pushing the envelope in this direction in the context of reinforcement learning.
My current research revolves around advancing RNNs for a variety of tasks including time series classification, sequential text document classification, and conditional computing.
