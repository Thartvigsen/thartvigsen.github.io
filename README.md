## Introduction

I am a Data Science Ph.D student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My interests lie in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, specifically for sequential data. I currently work on clinical time series with the aim of detecting infections as early as possible. This is the beginning of my 2nd year at WPI and I plan to complete my Ph.D. in the Spring of 2021. This page will host my current CV and Resume, along with previous and current projects.
