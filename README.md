### Introduction

I am a second-year Data Science Ph.D student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I learned to love Machine Learning and Data Mining during my undergrad at SUNY Geneseo, where I worked on various research projects revolving around graph theory and natural language processing. Now, I get to fully invest myself in fascinating Machine Learning problems, eventually aiming for a faculty position. 

### Research Interests

- Machine Learning
- Deep Recurrent Models
- Sequential Data

### Current Research

### Past Projects

### Technology

I use Python for all of my programming due the overall speed of implementation. Testing ideas using Python is extremely rapid compared to lower-level languages and rapidly learning whether or not an idea may be fruitful is a great benefit. For Machine Learning I use NumPy and Scikit-Learn, for Deep Learning I use TensorFlow.

### Education

B.A. Applied Mathematics, Minor in BioMathematics, 2016, SUNY Geneseo.

### Extra
Outside of my research I spend time on my road bike (Giant TCR Advanced) and reading fantasy books.
