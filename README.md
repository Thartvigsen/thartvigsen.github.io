I am a Data Science Ph.D. student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute working with [Dr. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst), [Dr. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/), and [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/). I focus on Conditional Computing in Recurrent Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. I am eventually aiming for a faculty position.

Please feel free to contact me with questions regarding my research or Data Science at WPI at **twhartvigsen@wpi.edu**.

# Current Research

I am currently interested in learning patterns in time series as early as possible, analogous to  predictions using the shortest possible time series prefixes. In many domains, the evaluation of a predictive model should not only be accuracy, but a trade-off between accuracy and earliness. For instance, detecting an infection perfectly immediately before a discriminative test is given has almost no potential impact, while a less accurate prediction made far in advance of infection has potential to positively impact a patient's stay. While so far my work has been evaluated on Electronic Health Records, I am far more interested in the techniques, and these problems are present in many domains.
