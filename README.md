I'm a Ph.D student in Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying machine learning for sequential data, advised by [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) and collaborating with [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

# Research objectives

My research focuses on representation learning, building low-dimensional representations of the physical world for a variety of machine learning tasks. Decisions we make rely heavily on models of the world which we meticulously cultivate through experience and I am interested in enabling artificially intelligent machines through the development of such models. Eventually I would like to approach representation learning problems through the lense of early childhood development. Ultimately, this is taking me down the path of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks, which together loosely emulate how human brains process information. My current and previous focus has been on building sequential representations of clinical decision making scenarios with high levels of uncertainty: noisy sensors, infrequent and irregular variable recordings, and unexplained clinical actions, mandating assumptions from machine learning-based decision support systems.

# Personal

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](/images/climbing2.jpg), [cycling](/images/bike.jpg), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/59979444) (fantasy, science fiction, science fact), and music (I play guitar/violin and listen mainly to folk and indie rock).
