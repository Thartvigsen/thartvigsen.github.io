I'm a Ph.D student in Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying machine learning for sequential data, advised by [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) and collaborating with [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

# Research objectives

I am broadly interested in representation learning to build low-dimensional representations of the physical world for a variety of machine learning tasks. When we make decisions we heavily rely on a model of the world which we meticulously cultivate throughout our lives. Most of our "interactions" with the world are passive - we don't need to drop thousands of objects to understand the effects of gravity. I am interested in enabling artificially intelligent machines through the development of such models, which seem essential to animal intelligence, and am particularly interested in the learning process of children and how they cultivate their representations of the world. Recently, this agenda has led me down the path of recurrent neural networks (RNN), which loosely emulate human information representation. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and how it models sequential decision making, a crucial part of the human learning process. My current focus is on building sequential representations of clinical decision making scenarios with high levels of uncertainty: noisy sensors, infrequent and irregular variable recordings, and unexplained clinical actions, mandating assumptions from machine learning-based decision support systems.

# Personal

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](/images/climbing2.jpg), [cycling](/images/bike.jpg), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/59979444) (fantasy and science outreach), and music (I play guitar/violin and listen mainly to folk, indie rock, and power metal).
