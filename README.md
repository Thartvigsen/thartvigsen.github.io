I am a Data Science Ph.D. student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute working with [Dr. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst), [Dr. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/), and [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/). I focus on Conditional Computing in Recurrent Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. I am eventually aiming for a faculty position.

- B.A. Applied Mathematics, Minor in BioMathematics, 2016, SUNY Geneseo.

# Current Research

I am currently interested in learning patterns in time series as early as possible.
In many domains, the evaluation of a predictive model should not only be accuracy, but a trade-off between accuracy and earliness.
In general I am interested in modeling very long sequences and sensor fusion through Recurrent Neural Networks.
While so far my work has been evaluated in the clinical domain, I am far more interested in the theory behind these techniques, and these problems are present in many domains.
