## Introduction

I am a Second-Year Data Science Ph.D student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I learned to love Machine Learning and Data Mining during my undergrad at SUNY Geneseo, where I worked on various research projects revolving around graph theory and natural language processing. Now, I am working full-time on fascinating Machine Learning problems, eventually aiming for a faculty position.
