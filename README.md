I'm a Ph.D student in Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying machine learning for sequential data, advised by [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) and collaborating with [Cansu Sen](http://users.wpi.edu/~csen/) in the [Data Science Research Group](http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

# Interests

I am broadly interested in human learning and how we can emulate this process in computers, particularly how computers can build *useful* representations of the world. Recently, this agenda has led me down the path of recurrent neural networks (RNN), which loosely emulate human information representation. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and how it models sequential decision making, an integral part of how we interact with the world. My current research revolves around advancing RNNs for a variety of tasks including time series classification, sequential text document classification, and conditional computing.

# Personal

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](/images/climbing2.jpg), [cycling](/images/bike.jpg), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/59979444) (fantasy and science outreach), and music (I play guitar/violin and listen mainly to folk, indie rock, and power metal).
