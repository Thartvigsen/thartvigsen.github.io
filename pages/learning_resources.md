# Gaining background in Machine Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks

First, you need to understand the methods we are going to use to solve cool problems this summer. This project is under the umbrella of **Machine Learning** as we are trying to predict the labels of time series data. We are investigating a **Deep Learning** algorithm called **Recurrent Neural Networks**.

The topics you need to have a strong grasp on are:
* Basic Machine Learning
* Deep Feedforward Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks

# Reading List
* [Deep Learning Textbook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    * Part I - [Chapter 5](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html)
    * Part II - [Chapter 6](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html), [Chapter 7](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/regularization.html), [Chapter 10](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html)
    * More in depth:
        * Chapter 8, particularly 8.2.5
        * My interests: 10.7, 10.9, 10.11
* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
* [Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/)
* [Stanford cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io/): This course has very clear descriptions of complex deep learning topics. I recommend *Neural Networks* parts [1](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/), [2](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/), and [3](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/).
* [Understanding LSTMs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/): This is the integral update to the classic RNN that allowed for the success seen by RNNs. If you get through here and feel that you have a good enough understanding to explain the intuition of an RNN with LSTM memory cells, then you are doing fantastic!

# Videos
  * [Andrew Ng's Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): If you are unfamiliar with deep learning, please watch these videos in sequence. There is no need to pour time into the homeworks, but they can be valuable resources as well. Videos are also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PiK4wtfvbA&list=PLBAGcD3siRDguyYYzhVwZ3tLvOyyG5k6K). Please watch the RNN videos, they are short.
