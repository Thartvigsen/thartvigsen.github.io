Hi! I received my PhD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute where I worked with [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/).

I am starting at MIT as a postdoc working with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/) in January.

Hi! I'm a Data Science Ph.D. candidate at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) and a member of the [DAISY Lab](http://daisy.wpi.edu), advised by [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/).

In my research, I aim to build systems that learn from large amounts of data to support time-sensitive decision making in ongoing environments without perpetuating societal biases.
To this end, I build **data mining** and **machine learning** models and tools for mainly **time series** and **text**.

-->

My work has been published in several top papers (KDD, NeurIPS, AAAI, ACL) and I spent a year collaborating with the UMass Medical School using machine learning to help doctors write better clinical trials faster.

My research is funded by a [GAANN Research Fellowship](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gaann/index.html) and with robust methods in hand, I aim to improve **healthcare**.

Please feel free to contact me, I am always happy to chat!

Current interests:
- Auditing pre-trained models: How can I tell what *general properties* of input data will convince my model? How do I correct a pre-trained model's bad behavior?
- Modeling data and label collection: Training data determine the behavior and performance of machine learning models. Which data instances get added to a dataset? Which ones get labeled? Modern models are data hungry so collection and labeling procedures have large influences on the behavior of a model. How can we model the influence of these mechanisms from data collection, to labeling, to eventual machine inference?
- Representing irregularly-sampled data: When data are collected irregularly, deep learning models don't work out of the box anymore because they require fixed-length inputs. However, despite a recent surge in methods that can reconstruct continuous-timelines (like NODEs), simpler models that just discretize time seem to work just as well (if not better). How can we tell when a continuous-time representation learner is required compared to a simpler discrete method?

### Misc

Outside of research, I enjoy [bouldering](/images/climbing2.jpg), [biking](/images/bike.jpg), books (fantasy, science fiction, science fact), birding, and playing guitar.
I also spent a summer living at [BioSphere 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2) in rural Arizona.
