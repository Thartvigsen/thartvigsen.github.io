Hi! I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in our Data Science program, a part of the Computer Science department.
Broadly, I am interested in sequence modeling and so my research has revolved heavily around Recurrent Neural Networks.
Ultimately I aim to advance sustainability in machine learning and apply machine learning to sustainability challenges, motivated by the low power consumption of the human brain and the massive carbon footprint of modern deep learning.

I am advised by [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/).

# Specific Research Interests

I am interested in sequence modeling, or building vector representations that capture relevant temporal dynamics in sequential data such as time series or text. So far, I have studied early classification, clinical note classification, meta word embeddings, explainable neural time series classification, and representation learning for irregularly-sampled time series. Most of my work involves some form of *conditional computing in RNNs*. I have also had the pleasure of advising many NSF-funded REU students over the summers on some research involving missing values in clinical time series and sequential diagnosis prediction using RNNs.

Please feel free to contact me with questions regarding my research or our program at WPI at twhartvigsen 'at' wpi 'dot' edu. I would be happy to go into much more detail on my research one-on-one.

# Personal

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](/images/climbing2.jpg), [cycling](/images/bike.jpg), reading (fantasy, science fiction, science fact), and playing guitar.
