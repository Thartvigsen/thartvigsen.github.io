<!--
Hi! I am a postdoc at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)/[IMES](https://imes.mit.edu/) working with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/) on machine learning for health.

I received my PhD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute where I worked with [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) as a member of the [DAISY Lab](http://daisy.wpi.edu).

Hi! I'm a Data Science Ph.D. candidate at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) and a member of the [DAISY Lab](http://daisy.wpi.edu), advised by [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/).

In my research, I aim to build systems that learn from large amounts of data to support time-sensitive decision making in ongoing environments without perpetuating societal biases.
To this end, I build **data mining** and **machine learning** models and tools for primarily **time series** and **text**.

My work is currently funded by a [GAANN Research Fellowship](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gaann/index.html) and with robust methods in hand, I aim to improve healthcare and fight climate change.

My work has resulted in several top papers (KDD, AAAI, ACL, CIKM) and I spent a year collaborating with the UMass Medical School using machine learning to help doctors write better clinical trials faster.

Please feel free to contact me with questions about my research or our program at WPI. I am always happy to chat!

### Misc

Outside of research, I enjoy [bouldering](/images/climbing2.jpg), [biking](/images/bike.jpg), books (fantasy, science fiction, science fact), birding, and playing guitar.
I also spent a summer living at [BioSphere 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2) in rural Arizona.
