Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute advised by [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) and [Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/) in the Data Science program, a part of the Computer Science department. I work on a variety of sequence modeling problems, often motivated by healthcare applications.

<!---
Ultimately I aim to advance sustainability in machine learning and apply machine learning to sustainability challenges, motivated by the low power consumption of the human brain and the massive carbon footprint of modern deep learning. Much of my work has also focused on human health and I look forward to continuing to solve impactful problems in this domain!

### Interests

I am interested in sequence modeling, or building vector representations that capture relevant temporal dynamics in sequential data such as time series or text. So far, I have studied and published on early classification, clinical note classification, attention mechanisms for RNNs, meta word embeddings, interpretable machine learning, and irregularly-sampled time series. Much of my work involves some form of *conditional computing in RNNs*. I have also had the pleasure of advising many NSF-funded REU students over the summers on some research involving missing values in clinical time series and sequential diagnosis prediction using RNNs. On the [Publications](https://thartvigsen.github.io/publications/) page I describe some of my representative research in more detail. I seek meaninful applications to problems of human health and sustainability (particularly wildlife conservation).

Please feel free to contact me with questions regarding my research or our program at WPI. I would be happy to go into much more detail on my research one-on-one.

### Personal

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](/images/climbing2.jpg), [cycling](/images/bike.jpg), reading (fantasy, science fiction, science fact), and playing guitar.
