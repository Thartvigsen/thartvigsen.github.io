#### Writing papers
There's a lot of useful info out there on how to write good papers. Here's what I've found helpful over the years, but the best advice I've received so far *pick a good book about writing and read it once a year* (I use [On Writing Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser).
- [How to write a great research paper](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/PhD/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf)

#### Doing research
- [A PhD is not enough](https://www.amazon.com/PhD-Not-Enough-Survival-Science/dp/0465022227)
- [How to do good research, get it published in SIGKDD and get it cited!](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Keogh_SIGKDD09_tutorial.pdf)
