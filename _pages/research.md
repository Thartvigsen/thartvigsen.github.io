**Very** under construction, beware!

A list of recent RNN-theory papers that I find interesting:
- [Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09913.pdf)
- [Understanding and Controlling Memory in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07275.pdf)
