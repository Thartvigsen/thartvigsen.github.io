I have collaborated to publish 9 papers with 3 under review and 4 more on the way! I will be filling out this page to describe each project but at a high level, my work typically involves developing novel recurrent neural networks (RNN) for challenging real-world time series classification tasks. On the more-theoretical side I have a paper under submission regarding conditional computation in RNNs with one follow-up on the way. I have also colalborated on clinical note classification and word meta-embedding.
