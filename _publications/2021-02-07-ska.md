In this paper, we define the open problem of Semi-Supervised Knowledge Amalgamation (SKA) and propose its very first solution, which we demonstrate using sequence classification tasks. The goal of SKA is to use a set of pre-trained *teacher* models and a tiny set of labeled data to train a *student* model that can predict any of the teachers' classes accurately. In the paper, we demosntrate that using the tiny labeled data to learn which teachers to trust, we can train one student model that is more accurate than any of the teacher students.
